=======

We present AR spells, an interactive augmented reality game on Microsoft’s
Hololens which combines a tower-defense style game with a crafting system to
create spells using tangibles.

The goal of our work was to build an augmented reality application with tangible interactions using Hololens.
We propose “AR Spells” a game where the user can interact with a augmented reality map by
killing the monsters using tangible interaction to select the right spell. The
paper retraces the creation of the application from the source of its conception
to its technological design.

The project was presented during the 2019
exhibition from students of the Master in Human Computer Interaction and Design.
The evaluation and possible evolution imagined after this exhibition are
presented as well.
