=======

Wall-holo is a top-down perspective puzzle game made in 48h for Ludum Dare 31. You are in a labyrinth and each time you move, the walls move too. Find the right moves to reach the exit.

On one level to another, all the walls were supposed to rearrange themselves to form the next level in order to stick with the theme. Not exactly what we have been able to do but that's the idea.

Instructions: Use the arrow keys to move and press R to respawn if you are stuck. Reach the red checkpoints to go to the next level. The green checkpoint is the active checkpoint. Blue checkpoints are standard checkpoints.
